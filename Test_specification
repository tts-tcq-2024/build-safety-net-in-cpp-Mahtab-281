1. Test Name: HandlesEmptyString
Description: Validates the behavior of generateSoundex when an empty string is provided.
Test Input: "" (empty string)
Expected Output: "" (empty string)

2. Test Name: HandlesSingleCharacter
Description: Ensures that single alphabetic characters (A-Z) are correctly converted to their respective Soundex codes, followed by three zeros.
Test Input: Any single alphabetic character (e.g., "A", "B", "C", ... "Z")
Expected Output: The character followed by three zeros (e.g., "A000", "B000", "C000", ..., "Z000")

3. Test Name: HandlesIgnoredCharacters
Description: Tests the handling of characters that should be ignored in the Soundex algorithm. These include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and specific consonants like H and W.
Test Input: Various strings with only vowels and consonants that should be ignored, including "AEIOU", "EAIOU", "HW", and "WH".
Expected Output: The first character, followed by three zeros (e.g., "A000", "E000", "H000", "W000")

4. Test Name: HandlesAdjacentConsonants
Description: Ensures that adjacent consonants with the same Soundex code are correctly reduced to a single representation. Each consonant is mapped to its respective Soundex code.
Test Input: Strings containing two adjacent consonants, such as "BB", "CC", "DD", etc.
Expected Output: The correct Soundex code for each consonant, e.g., "B100" for "BB", "C200" for "CC", "D300" for "DD", and so on.

5. Test Name: HandlesLongNames
Description: Tests that names with multiple characters are processed correctly, including the truncation or padding to ensure the Soundex code has four characters.
Test Input: Strings like "Soundex", "Generate", and "Function"
Expected Output: Correct Soundex code for each string (e.g., "S532" for "Soundex", "G563" for "Generate", "F523" for "Function")

6. Test Name: HandlesHyphensAndSpaces
Description: Ensures that hyphens and spaces in names are ignored and do not affect the resulting Soundex code.
Test Input: Strings such as "Soundex-Code" and "Generate Function"
Expected Output: Correct Soundex code, ignoring non-alphabetic characters (e.g., "S532" for "Soundex-Code", "G563" for "Generate Function")

7. Test Name: HandlesNonAlphabeticCharacters
Description: Tests that non-alphabetic characters like punctuation and numbers are ignored in the Soundex generation.
Test Input: Strings such as "Func@123" and "Gen#erate"
Expected Output: Correct Soundex code, ignoring non-alphabetic characters (e.g., "F520" for "Func@123", "G563" for "Gen#erate")
